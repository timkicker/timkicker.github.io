Sadly not yet. I am currently collecting anonymous user data. You can view what's collected on [my stats-page](https://stats.kicker.dev/share/1Ui8dKfjsfQGAVs5/tim.kicker.dev).
I also submitted this site to the google & bing developer consoles to measure my search engine rating.
It is important to mention, that i do not use google analytics (even if some comments in the html state otherwise). Additionally, i just recently moved from disqus to [isso](https://isso-comments.de/), which is a selfhosted and privacy respecting alternative.

Of course!

It is entirely [open source](https://git.kicker.dev/timkicker/tim.kicker.dev).
