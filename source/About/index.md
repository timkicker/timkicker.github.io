Hi! 

Hi there!

I'm Tim, a young student from Austria with an insatiable passion for programming. But that's not all—I'm also enthusiastic about many other topics that I love to share and discuss.

Since describing myself with sentences can be tricky, let's break it down with some code:

{% codeblock lang:cs %}
var tK = new Person("Tim","Kicker");

tK.State = "Austria";
tK.Interests = {"Linux",
                "Selfhosting",
                "Vinyl",
                "Data curation",
                "Privacy Guardance"};

tK.FavGames = {"Half-Life 2",
               "Lego Universe",
               "Far Cry 3",
               "Portal 2"};

tK.FavLang = "CSharp";
tK.FavColor = Color.Black; 
            // if that's a real color?

{% endcodeblock %}
