            <h2>The Selfhosting Experience</h2>

  <p>I‚Äôve been running my own server for about 2.5 years now and have gained a lot of experience in the process. Since a friend of mine asked about my setup and some tipps, I thought it would be best to publish another blog post on this topic. This is one of my more tech-savvy posts, so feel free to skip it if you‚Äôre not interested (as if I have any say in this‚Ä¶). I‚Äôll keep this entry updated as long as I‚Äôm willing to. VPN-Section is coming soon.</p>
<p><img src="/2024/06/26/the-selfhosting-experience/wondering.png"></p>
<p>Me, sometime at the beginning of 2022</p>
<h2 id="Reasoning"><a href="#Reasoning" class="headerlink" title="Reasoning"></a>Reasoning</h2><p>Why would you actually want to host everything yourself in the first place? I mean, it‚Äôs a lot of work, a ton of stress, and requires constant maintenance?</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Availability</strong>: Every single day approximately <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://themeisle.com/blog/how-many-websites-are-there/">3,992,222 websites are created</a> (which is a lot, WTF). However, many sites also become unavailable, leading to data loss, like the shutdown of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424356/liveleak-shock-site-shuts-down-itemfix">LiveLeak</a>, the deletion of YouTube channels, or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/otilliasteadman/pornhub-removes-videos">countless minutes of pornographic material</a>. There are even entire communities dedicated to gathering so-called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lostmedia/top/?t=all">lost media</a>. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ownership</strong><br>Another problem we encounter is that we do not own anything anymore. Seriously, every type of media most people consume comes from streaming services like YouTube, Netflix, Disney+, or Spotify. Every file we consume is rented and not owned by ourselves. Self-hosting, on the other hand, ensures your data never gets lost and is completely owned by you and only you.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Privacy</strong>: Your data remains on your premises, reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access that might occur on third-party servers. Of course some of your applications will share information with third parties but at least you‚Äôll be more in control on who has your data</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Complete Control</strong>: You have full control over the software, configurations, and data. You can customize everything to meet your specific requirements.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Gaining Technical Skills</strong>: Managing your own server helps you develop valuable skills in system administration, networking, security, and troubleshooting. And trust me, there‚Äôll be a lot of troubleshooting‚Ä¶</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Open Source Support</strong>: By self-hosting, you can support and utilize open-source software, contributing to and benefiting from community-driven projects.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Data Sovereignty</strong>: Ensures that your data resides within your jurisdiction, avoiding legal complications associated with cross-border data transfer.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Reliability</strong>: You can design your infrastructure for high availability and redundancy, ensuring continuous service without relying on third-party uptime. Like still being able to access your media in case of a network outage.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Customization</strong>: You can tailor the software and services to your exact needs, adding features or making changes that hosted solutions might not allow.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Cost Savings</strong>: Over time, self-hosting can be more cost-effective than paying for recurring subscription fees for hosted services. Keep in mind that the initial costs will be enormous though!</p>
</li>
<li><p>You may also use your server-project on your resume or use it for content if you run out of material for your blogs :)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="What-to-keep-in-mind"><a href="#What-to-keep-in-mind" class="headerlink" title="What to keep in mind"></a>What to keep in mind</h2><p>Let me tell you this before you even start to think about starting your own server: It‚Äôll cost you a <del>fuck ton</del> lot of nerves and time. Don‚Äôt go into this project thinking it will be easy and you will be done in no time. It requires a lot of troubleshooting, a lot of research, and a huge pile of failures. You‚Äôll need discipline to stay on track.</p>
<p>You‚Äôll gain a considerable amount of technical knowledge, but you‚Äôll also need some basic networking skills. Take some time to study those basic abilities before you start this project. Stop browsing Reddit for the best dashboard theme if you cannot tell me how DHCP works.</p>
<p>Depending on your situation, there may be a lot of initial costs for the hardware you‚Äôll use. I was lucky enough to use my ‚Äúold‚Äù gaming PC since I grew out of my gaming phase a long time ago. I know it isn‚Äôt energy-efficient at all, but it works for now (you‚Äôll encounter this situation a lot during this or similar software projects).</p>
<h2 id="My-setup"><a href="#My-setup" class="headerlink" title="My setup"></a>My setup</h2><p><img src="/2024/06/26/the-selfhosting-experience/dashboard.png"></p>
<p>I am currently using Ubuntu LTS, as it‚Äôs a pretty reliable operating system for servers. There are countless alternatives like Debian or RockyLinux. However, if I had to restart this project from scratch, I‚Äôd probably go with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.openmediavault.org/">OpenMediaVault</a> this time.</p>
<p>I chose to run all my applications using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.docker.com/why-docker/">Docker</a> because I think it‚Äôs the best way to run server applications. Docker allows us to package applications into containers, each containing the application code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies needed to run the application consistently across different environments.</p>
<p>Since most self-proclaimed administrators choose to set up a dashboard to maintain a clear perspective on my applications, I opted not to include things like a search engine or third-party websites such as some social media sites, since I only use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer">this dashboard</a> for navigation and nothing else.</p>
<h2 id="Media"><a href="#Media" class="headerlink" title="Media"></a>Media</h2><p><img src="/2024/06/26/the-selfhosting-experience/media.png"></p>
<h3 id="Plex"><a href="#Plex" class="headerlink" title="Plex"></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://watch.plex.tv/en-GB">Plex</a></h3><p>The Plex home server application is a media server software that allows users to organize, manage, and stream their personal media collections, including movies, TV shows, music, and photos, to various devices. Plex Media Server is installed on a computer or NAS (Network Attached Storage) device, where it scans and catalogs the user‚Äôs media, adding metadata and artwork for a polished library presentation. Users can then access their media from anywhere using the Plex app on smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, streaming devices, and web browsers. Plex also offers additional features such as live TV and DVR capabilities, support for various plugins, and premium options like Plex Pass for enhanced functionality and content access wich was bought by me. Alternatives like Emby &amp; Jellyfin (Open Source) exsit, but have not been thested by me.</p>
<h3 id="Calibre-Web"><a href="#Calibre-Web" class="headerlink" title="Calibre Web"></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web">Calibre Web</a></h3><p> A web-based application that provides a user-friendly interface for managing and accessing eBook collections stored in a Calibre database.

<h2 id="Server"><a href="#Server" class="headerlink" title="Server"></a>Server</h2><p><img src="/2024/06/26/the-selfhosting-experience/server.png"></p>
<p>Those applications are (in my opinion) essential for managing a server as they make life so so much easier.</p>
<h3 id="Portainer"><a href="#Portainer" class="headerlink" title="Portainer"></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.portainer.io/">Portainer</a></h3><p> A lightweight, web-based management UI for Docker, Docker Swarm, and Kubernetes that simplifies container and cluster management.

Keep in mind that you wont be able to share files over 500MB if you run it through a Cloudflare proxy. I mainly use this inside my network or for sharing media for direct-viewing or small documents</p>
<h2 id="Download"><a href="#Download" class="headerlink" title="Download"></a>Download</h2><p><img src="/2024/06/26/the-selfhosting-experience/download.png"></p>
<p>Making downloads on a home server offers several advantages over downloading directly on personal computers. Firstly, it offloads resource-intensive tasks like downloading large files or torrents, which can slow down or tie up local machines. It also centralizes management, allowing for continuous downloads even when individual computers are turned off. Additionally, a home server can automate downloads, manage storage more efficiently, and provide a centralized location for accessing downloaded files from any device on the network, enhancing convenience and accessibility.</p>

<h2 id="Some-tipps"><a href="#Some-tipps" class="headerlink" title="Some tipps"></a>Some tipps</h2><ul>
<li><strong>NEVER CHANGE A WORKING SYSTEM</strong>: Please, for the love of God, only update your server when you are willing to take a few hours to fix your entire setup if something fails. Because it will. Also, take some time to check if you <em>really, really</em> need this new fancy application, which is pretty much a duplicate of an existing one and you‚Äôll use it once for testing and never again afterwards. ‚ÄúbUt jUsT iN cAsE iLl kEeP it‚Äù, no you wont. Trust me, I‚Äôve been guilty of this behaviour several times.</li>
<li>Spend some time planning. Create a to-do list, plan when and how you want to work on it, and create a file tree. Here‚Äôs mine, for example:</li>
<li>Only use the root account if you have to. Create a separate one for all sorts of things, which will increase your security a ton.</li>
<li>Spend a lot of time on security. I know you just got your system to work after some hard days, and you are not motivated anymore in the slightest to upgrade your security, but please do it. I know you‚Äôll probably not get hacked or something like that, but the chance still exists. Take a look into topics like Firewalls, Cloudflare, VPN, etc.</li>
