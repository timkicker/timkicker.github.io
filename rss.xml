            <title>Rethinking Open Source Responsibility (EOL)</title>

            <description><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;For a while now, I’ve been playing with a thought experiment: &lt;strong&gt;what happens when your code is used for something you fundamentally disagree with?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open source is great. It encourages collaboration, innovation, and accessibility. But what it doesn’t do is ask whether there should be &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; limits on how software is used. Right now, if you release something under a permissive license, you’re essentially saying: “Here, take this. Use it for whatever you want.” And sometimes, that “whatever” includes mass surveillance, AI-driven discrimination, or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people argue that this is just the price of open-source. Once you put code out there, it’s out of your hands. But I started wondering: &lt;strong&gt;does it have to be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Fun fact: Apparently, just asking this question is enough to get your post removed from certain open-source communities. The conversation must be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; settled, right?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://socialify.git.ci/timkicker/eol/image?language=1&amp;logo=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timkicker/EOL/refs/heads/main/file_with_handshake.png&amp;name=1&amp;owner=1&amp;stargazers=1&amp;theme=Light&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;What-Is-the-Ethical-Open-License-EOL&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#What-Is-the-Ethical-Open-License-EOL&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;What Is the Ethical Open License (EOL)?&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What Is the Ethical Open License (EOL)?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Ethical Open License (EOL)&lt;/strong&gt; is a hypothetical licensing model that explores whether open-source can include ethical restrictions. This isn’t about restricting everyday users or stifling innovation. It’s about setting clear boundaries on how software &lt;em&gt;shouldn’t&lt;/em&gt; be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under EOL, your software &lt;strong&gt;cannot&lt;/strong&gt; be used for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mass surveillance&lt;/strong&gt; – No large-scale tracking, unauthorized data collection, or government spying programs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autonomous weapons&lt;/strong&gt; – Your code should not end up in military AI systems or automated combat technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discriminatory AI&lt;/strong&gt; – No training models that reinforce bias or make decisions based on race, gender, or social class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploitation networks&lt;/strong&gt; – No use in systems that facilitate child abuse, human trafficking, or other crimes that exploit vulnerable individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises a fair question: &lt;em&gt;who decides what’s ethical?&lt;/em&gt; That’s something that would need clearer definition (which, to be fair, has been one of the biggest criticisms). But ignoring the question entirely doesn’t seem like the best answer either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;How-Does-EOL-Work-If-It-Did-Work&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#How-Does-EOL-Work-If-It-Did-Work&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;How Does EOL Work? (If It Did Work?)&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How Does EOL Work? (If It Did Work?)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;EOL would follow a familiar open-source structure, but with added restrictions on unethical use. It would grant users the right to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use, modify, and distribute the software freely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute to the project under the same ethical guidelines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fork or create derivatives as long as they comply with the license terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if an entity is found to be violating the ethical clauses of the license, they &lt;strong&gt;lose their right to use the software&lt;/strong&gt;. This would be enforced through a &lt;strong&gt;defined process&lt;/strong&gt;, ideally involving an independent review board (if one could exist without being a bureaucratic nightmare). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid ambiguity, EOL also provides a &lt;strong&gt;defined process&lt;/strong&gt; for addressing violations. This would ideally involve an independent review process where complaints can be filed, reviewed, and addressed based on available evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a violation is confirmed, the offending party is expected to cease the unethical use immediately or risk losing access to the software under the terms of the license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, enforceability is a huge concern – another major critique. If bad actors don’t follow the law, why would they follow a license? That’s a fair point, but licensing isn’t always about stopping the worst offenders. Sometimes, it’s about setting expectations and norms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;The-Cost-Model-of-EOL&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#The-Cost-Model-of-EOL&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;The Cost Model of EOL&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Cost Model of EOL&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One important question that comes up with any new license is: &lt;strong&gt;how does the cost model work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EOL itself is, like most open-source licenses, &lt;strong&gt;free to use&lt;/strong&gt;. Any developer, company, or organization can adopt the license without paying fees. However, the enforcement mechanisms and the potential establishment of an independent ethics review board (IERB) introduce some financial considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;Potential-Costs-and-Funding-Sources&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Potential-Costs-and-Funding-Sources&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Potential Costs and Funding Sources&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Costs and Funding Sources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Governance (Free Model)&lt;/strong&gt;  –  In its simplest form, projects adopting EOL could rely on community-driven enforcement, where violations are reported and discussed publicly. This keeps costs low but relies heavily on volunteer effort and public pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethics Review Board (IERB)&lt;/strong&gt;  –  If a formal IERB were established, it would require funding for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legal reviews of complaints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investigations into reported misuse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Administrative work related to enforcement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be supported through:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corporate sponsorships&lt;/strong&gt; from organizations that believe in ethical open-source development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crowdfunding and donations&lt;/strong&gt; from developers and supporters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A tiered compliance model&lt;/strong&gt; where companies using EOL-licensed software commercially contribute a small fee toward maintaining ethical oversight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hybrid Approach&lt;/strong&gt;  –  A mix of self-governance and optional paid enforcement. Smaller projects could rely on community oversight, while larger commercial users could opt into a paid compliance system that helps fund ethical review and enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact cost model isn’t set in stone – it’s something that would need to be refined based on community feedback and practical needs. The core idea, however, is that ethical enforcement doesn’t have to be a barrier to open-source adoption, but it does require some thought into sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;The-Royalty-Structure-of-EOL&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#The-Royalty-Structure-of-EOL&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;The Royalty Structure of EOL&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Royalty Structure of EOL&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m still not entirely sure if a royalty model is the right approach or if it would actually be beneficial. The idea is to create a way for large-scale commercial users to contribute back to the ethical enforcement of open-source projects, but whether this is the best method is something that needs further discussion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of EOL is its &lt;strong&gt;royalty model&lt;/strong&gt; for commercial use. While individuals, nonprofits, and small companies can use the software freely, larger companies generating significant revenue directly from EOL-licensed software are expected to contribute back to the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;Royalty-Rates-Based-on-Annual-Gross-Revenue&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Royalty-Rates-Based-on-Annual-Gross-Revenue&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Royalty Rates Based on Annual Gross Revenue&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Royalty Rates Based on Annual Gross Revenue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Annual Gross Revenue&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Royalty Rate&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Less than $1,000,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$1,000,000 - $5,000,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;More than $5,000,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These royalties are calculated based on &lt;strong&gt;annual gross revenue directly attributable to the software or its derivative work&lt;/strong&gt;. The goal is to ensure that successful commercial ventures built on EOL-licensed software contribute fairly to its maintenance and ethical enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funds collected through royalties can be allocated toward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supporting ethical enforcement efforts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintaining an independent review process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Funding security audits and compliance verification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensuring long-term sustainability of ethically governed open-source projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model helps create a balance between free access for non-commercial use and fair compensation for commercial beneficiaries, ensuring that ethical oversight remains feasible without burdening smaller developers or independent contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;The-Biggest-Pushbacks&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#The-Biggest-Pushbacks&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;The Biggest Pushbacks&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Biggest Pushbacks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(And Why They Might Be Right)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;“Isn’t-open-source-supposed-to-be-neutral-”&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#“Isn’t-open-source-supposed-to-be-neutral-”&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;“Isn’t open-source supposed to be neutral?”&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;“Isn’t open-source supposed to be neutral?”&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea has always been that developers provide the tools, and it’s not their job to dictate how those tools are used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But software isn’t neutral. A powerful AI model isn’t just some abstract tool – it actively shapes real-world outcomes. A social media algorithm doesn’t just recommend content – it determines what millions of people see and believe. And if we, as developers, recognize that, why should we act as if we have no role in what happens next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where EOL comes in – not as a perfect solution, but as a proposal for a different way of thinking about open-source responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;“This-isn’t-open-source-Stop-pretending-it-is-”&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#“This-isn’t-open-source-Stop-pretending-it-is-”&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;“This isn’t open source. Stop pretending it is.”&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;“This isn’t open source. Stop pretending it is.”&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, fair. It doesn’t fit the OSI definition, which says that open-source software must allow unrestricted use. If &lt;em&gt;that’s&lt;/em&gt; the definition you go by, then sure, EOL isn’t open source. But if you see open source as something that can evolve, it’s at least worth talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;“Ethics-are-subjective-You-can’t-put-them-in-a-license-”&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#“Ethics-are-subjective-You-can’t-put-them-in-a-license-”&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;“Ethics are subjective. You can’t put them in a license.”&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;“Ethics are subjective. You can’t put them in a license.”&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Completely true. What’s considered ethical today might not be in 50 years. But laws and policies shift too, and we don’t abandon them just because they’re hard to define. The challenge isn’t that ethics change—it’s how to define them in a way that works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;“Nobody-would-use-this-because-it’s-legally-vague-”&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#“Nobody-would-use-this-because-it’s-legally-vague-”&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;“Nobody would use this because it’s legally vague.”&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;“Nobody would use this because it’s legally vague.”&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly, that’s a solid argument. If a license introduces too much risk, companies won’t touch it. If something like EOL were to work, it would need &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; clear definitions and solid legal backing. Right now, it’s more of a conversation starter than a practical tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;“Bad-actors-won’t-follow-the-license-anyway-”&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#“Bad-actors-won’t-follow-the-license-anyway-”&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;“Bad actors won’t follow the license anyway.”&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;“Bad actors won’t follow the license anyway.”&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;True again. If someone wants to build something awful, they won’t stop because a license tells them not to. But a license isn’t just about enforcement—it’s about setting a precedent. Big companies &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; care about compliance, and even if this wouldn’t stop everything, it might influence how some organizations think about responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;So…-Is-This-a-Good-Idea-Probably-Not-But-It’s-Worth-Discussing&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#So…-Is-This-a-Good-Idea-Probably-Not-But-It’s-Worth-Discussing&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;So… Is This a Good Idea? Probably Not. But It’s Worth Discussing.&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So… Is This a Good Idea? Probably Not. But It’s Worth Discussing.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying EOL is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; answer. I’m not even saying it’s &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; good answer. What I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; saying is that open-source has a responsibility problem that’s at least worth thinking about. If the reaction is just “shut up, open source is freedom,” then maybe the conversation is overdue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Ethical Open License (EOL)&lt;/strong&gt; is up on GitHub. It’s not a finished product. It’s an open discussion. If you’re interested, check it out and let me know your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👉 &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/timkicker/EOL&#34;&gt;github.com&amp;#x2F;timkicker&amp;#x2F;EOL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;Whether-this-turns-into-something-real-or-just-sparks-a-broader-conversation-I’ll-count-that-as-a-win&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Whether-this-turns-into-something-real-or-just-sparks-a-broader-conversation-I’ll-count-that-as-a-win&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Whether this turns into something real or just sparks a broader conversation, I’ll count that as a win.&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Whether this turns into something real or just sparks a broader conversation, I’ll count that as a win.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t see EOL as a replacement for MIT, GPL, or other widely adopted licenses. But I do think it’s worth questioning the idea that software is inherently neutral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How our code gets used matters. And if we, as developers, have the ability to set ethical boundaries, why wouldn’t we consider it?&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The Selfhosting Experience</title>
            <link>https://tim.kicker.dev/2024/06/26/the-selfhosting-experience/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2024 18:20:59 +0000</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;I’ve been running my own server for about 2.5 years now and have gained a lot of experience in the process. Since a friend of mine asked about my setup and some tipps, I thought it would be best to publish another blog post on this topic. This is one of my more tech-savvy posts, so feel free to skip it if you’re not interested (as if I have any say in this…). I’ll keep this entry updated as long as I’m willing to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/2024/06/26/the-selfhosting-experience/wondering.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me, sometime at the beginning of 2022&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;Reasoning&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Reasoning&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Reasoning&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Reasoning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why would you actually want to host everything yourself in the first place? I mean, it’s a lot of work, a ton of stress, and requires constant maintenance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Availability&lt;/strong&gt;: Every single day approximately &lt;a href=&#34;https://themeisle.com/blog/how-many-websites-are-there/&#34;&gt;3,992,222 websites are created&lt;/a&gt; (which is a lot, WTF). However, many sites also become unavailable, leading to data loss, like the shutdown of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424356/liveleak-shock-site-shuts-down-itemfix&#34;&gt;LiveLeak&lt;/a&gt;, the deletion of YouTube channels, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/otilliasteadman/pornhub-removes-videos&#34;&gt;countless minutes of pornographic material&lt;/a&gt;. There are even entire communities dedicated to gathering so-called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/lostmedia/top/?t=all&#34;&gt;lost media&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ownership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another problem we encounter is that we do not own anything anymore. Seriously, every type of media most people consume comes from streaming services like YouTube, Netflix, Disney+, or Spotify. Every file we consume is rented and not owned by ourselves. Self-hosting, on the other hand, ensures your data never gets lost and is completely owned by you and only you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy&lt;/strong&gt;: Your data remains on your premises, reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access that might occur on third-party servers. Of course some of your applications will share information with third parties but at least you’ll be more in control on who has your data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complete Control&lt;/strong&gt;: You have full control over the software, configurations, and data. You can customize everything to meet your specific requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaining Technical Skills&lt;/strong&gt;: Managing your own server helps you develop valuable skills in system administration, networking, security, and troubleshooting. And trust me, there’ll be a lot of troubleshooting…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Source Support&lt;/strong&gt;: By self-hosting, you can support and utilize open-source software, contributing to and benefiting from community-driven projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Sovereignty&lt;/strong&gt;: Ensures that your data resides within your jurisdiction, avoiding legal complications associated with cross-border data transfer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reliability&lt;/strong&gt;: You can design your infrastructure for high availability and redundancy, ensuring continuous service without relying on third-party uptime. Like still being able to access your media in case of a network outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customization&lt;/strong&gt;: You can tailor the software and services to your exact needs, adding features or making changes that hosted solutions might not allow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost Savings&lt;/strong&gt;: Over time, self-hosting can be more cost-effective than paying for recurring subscription fees for hosted services. Keep in mind that the initial costs will be enormous though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may also use your server-project on your resume or use it for content if you run out of material for your blogs :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;What-to-keep-in-mind&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#What-to-keep-in-mind&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;What to keep in mind&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What to keep in mind&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you this before you even start to think about starting your own server: It’ll cost you a &lt;del&gt;fuck ton&lt;/del&gt; lot of nerves and time. Don’t go into this project thinking it will be easy and you will be done in no time. It requires a lot of troubleshooting, a lot of research, and a huge pile of failures. You’ll need discipline to stay on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll gain a considerable amount of technical knowledge, but you’ll also need some basic networking skills. Take some time to study those basic abilities before you start this project. Stop browsing Reddit for the best dashboard theme if you cannot tell me how DHCP works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on your situation, there may be a lot of initial costs for the hardware you’ll use. I was lucky enough to use my “old” gaming PC since I grew out of my gaming phase a long time ago. I know it isn’t energy-efficient at all, but it works for now (you’ll encounter this situation a lot during this or similar software projects).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may also be able to start of pretty cheap for most projects. Like you could buy a Raspi Zero for about &lt;a href=&#34;https://buyzero.de/collections/raspberry-pi-zero-kits/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w&#34;&gt;17 Euros nowadays&lt;/a&gt; when starting off. It’s not the most powerfull device but you’ll be able to host a few decent applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;My-setup&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#My-setup&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;My setup&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My setup&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/2024/06/26/the-selfhosting-experience/dashboard.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently using Ubuntu LTS, as it’s a pretty reliable operating system for servers. There are countless alternatives like Debian or RockyLinux. However, if I had to restart this project from scratch, I’d probably go with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.openmediavault.org/&#34;&gt;OpenMediaVault&lt;/a&gt; this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to run all my applications using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.docker.com/why-docker/&#34;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; because I think it’s the best way to run server applications. Docker allows us to package applications into containers, each containing the application code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies needed to run the application consistently across different environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since most self-proclaimed administrators choose to set up a dashboard to maintain a clear perspective on my applications, I opted not to include things like a search engine or third-party websites such as some social media sites, since I only use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer&#34;&gt;this dashboard&lt;/a&gt; for navigation and nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For maintainance and security, I also chose to host a Wireguard-VPN on a seperate device, which allows me to access my server remotely without going directly over the internet. This improves our security drastically while also offering some way of maintainance should the main-machine go offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;Media&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Media&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Media&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Media&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/2024/06/26/the-selfhosting-experience/media.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;Plex&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Plex&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Plex&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://watch.plex.tv/en-GB&#34;&gt;Plex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Plex home server application is a media server software that allows users to organize, manage, and stream their personal media collections, including movies, TV shows, music, and photos, to various devices. Plex Media Server is installed on a computer or NAS (Network Attached Storage) device, where it scans and catalogs the user’s media, adding metadata and artwork for a polished library presentation. Users can then access their media from anywhere using the Plex app on smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, streaming devices, and web browsers. Plex also offers additional features such as live TV and DVR capabilities, support for various plugins, and premium options like Plex Pass for enhanced functionality and content access wich was bought by me. Alternatives like Emby &amp;amp; Jellyfin (Open Source) exsit, but have not been thested by me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;Calibre-Web&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Calibre-Web&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Calibre Web&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web&#34;&gt;Calibre Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; A web-based application that provides a user-friendly interface for managing and accessing eBook collections stored in a Calibre database. It allows users to browse, read, and download eBooks via any web browser, offering features like metadata management, advanced search, and multi-user support with customizable permissions.

&lt;h3 id=&#34;Audiobookshelf&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Audiobookshelf&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Audiobookshelf&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.audiobookshelf.org/&#34;&gt;Audiobookshelf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also a web-app designed for managing and streaming audiobook collections. It allows users to organize their audiobooks, providing features like detailed metadata management, cover art, and chapter information. Users can stream their audiobooks from any device with a web browser, offering a seamless listening experience with features such as bookmarking, playback speed adjustment, and multi-user support for personalized access and library management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those applications are (in my opinion) essential for managing a server as they make life so so much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;Portainer&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Portainer&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Portainer&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.portainer.io/&#34;&gt;Portainer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; A lightweight, web-based management UI for Docker, Docker Swarm, and Kubernetes that simplifies container and cluster management.

It allows users to upload, download, edit, and organize files and directories from any device with a web browser. Key features include user authentication, customizable access permissions, support for various file operations, and a clean, responsive design for ease of use. FileBrowser is ideal for creating a simple and efficient file management system accessible over the web. Keep in mind that you wont be able to share files over 500MB if you run it through a Cloudflare proxy. I mainly use this inside my network or for sharing media for direct-viewing or small documents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;Download&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Download&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Download&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Download&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/2024/06/26/the-selfhosting-experience/download.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making downloads on a home server offers several advantages over downloading directly on personal computers. Firstly, it offloads resource-intensive tasks like downloading large files or torrents, which can slow down or tie up local machines. It also centralizes management, allowing for continuous downloads even when individual computers are turned off. Additionally, a home server can automate downloads, manage storage more efficiently, and provide a centralized location for accessing downloaded files from any device on the network, enhancing convenience and accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;QBittorrend-Web-VPN-Killswitch&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#QBittorrend-Web-VPN-Killswitch&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;QBittorrend Web + VPN Killswitch&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/MarkusMcNugen/docker-qBittorrentvpn&#34;&gt;QBittorrend Web + VPN Killswitch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A web-ui for managing the qBittorrent client, a popular open-source BitTorrent client.

Almost no site left has an enabled RSS feed, even if they had it once, and I am using RSS-Bridge because all social media sites are locking down access (Also called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification&#34;&gt;Enshittification&lt;/a&gt; of the internet). It fetches content from websites that do not provide their own RSS feeds and generates RSS feeds for users. This allows users to subscribe to updates from these websites using their preferred RSS feed reader. RSS-Bridge supports a wide range of sources including social media profiles, online forums, and other websites, providing a convenient way to aggregate content from different platforms into a single RSS feed for easier monitoring and consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, all my gaming-related containers are just plugins used for my Minecraft server. However, none of them are active at the moment as my Minecraft server has been shut down by me. Nevertheless, I still wanted to list them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEVER CHANGE A WORKING SYSTEM&lt;/strong&gt;: Please, for the love of God, only update your server when you are willing to take a few hours to fix your entire setup if something fails. Because it will. Also, take some time to check if you &lt;em&gt;really, really&lt;/em&gt; need this new fancy application, which is pretty much a duplicate of an existing one and you’ll use it once for testing and never again afterwards. “bUt jUsT iN cAsE iLl kEeP it”, no you wont. Trust me, I’ve been guilty of this behaviour several times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend some time planning. Create a to-do list, plan when and how you want to work on it, and create a file tree. Here’s mine, for example:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only use the root account if you have to. Create a separate one for all sorts of things, which will increase your security a ton.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend a lot of time on security. I know you just got your system to work after some hard days, and you are not motivated anymore in the slightest to upgrade your security, but please do it. I know you’ll probably not get hacked or something like that, but the chance still exists. Take a look into topics like Firewalls, Cloudflare, VPN, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obligatory (somewhat) fitting &lt;a href=&#34;/2024/06/26/the-selfhosting-experience/workflow.png&#34;&gt;xkxd comic&lt;/a&gt; regarding the working system&lt;/p&gt;

So I’ll link you some great resources, which helped me enormously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awesome Selfhosted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: A list of Free Software network services and web applications which can be hosted on your own servers.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>The first digital nomad</title>
            <link>https://tim.kicker.dev/2023/08/02/digital-nomad/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 02 Aug 2023 11:48:32 +0000</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, the idea of working remotely while traveling the world seemed like something straight out of a sci-fi novel. Yet, one man defied the norms of his time and embarked on a groundbreaking journey that would make him the first-ever digital nomad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/2023/08/02/digital-nomad/Behemoth.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven K. Roberts and “Behemoth”, taken from &lt;a href=&#34;https://teknomadics.com/2011/10/the-original-digital-nomad/&#34;&gt;Teknomadics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;A-Journey-Ahead-of-Its-Time&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#A-Journey-Ahead-of-Its-Time&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;A Journey Ahead of Its Time&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A Journey Ahead of Its Time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1983, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/nomadness&#34;&gt;Steven K Roberts&lt;/a&gt; set out on an extraordinary adventure, pedaling across the United States on a recumbent bicycle he called “Winnebiko” (his later  models were called “Winnebiko 2” and &lt;a href=&#34;https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behemoth_(Mythologie)&#34;&gt;“Behemoth”&lt;/a&gt;). What made this journey unique was the impressive array of technology packed into the bicycle’s streamlined body, including solar panels, a computer, a ham radio, and other cutting-edge gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roberts’ vision was to merge technology and nomadic living, proving that one could work remotely and stay connected with the world while exploring new horizons. As he traversed the American landscape, he chronicled his experiences and technological innovations in articles for &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Currents&#34;&gt;“Computer Currents” magazine&lt;/a&gt;, capturing the imaginations of readers everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/2023/08/02/digital-nomad/thumbnail.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven and his second bike, taken from &lt;a href=&#34;https://microship.com/bikes/&#34;&gt;his website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;Reactions-and-Comments&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Reactions-and-Comments&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Reactions and Comments&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Reactions and Comments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 1980s, Roberts’ audacious endeavor sparked both awe and skepticism. Many people were fascinated by his nomadic lifestyle and the creative use of technology to maintain communication and work on the go. They saw his journey as an inspirational tale of freedom and possibility, challenging the traditional notion of work confined to brick-and-mortar offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, others viewed Roberts’ quest with doubt and disbelief. The idea of working remotely and relying on technology to sustain such a lifestyle was seen as an eccentric and unrealistic notion (lol). Skeptics questioned the feasibility of his technological setup and doubted whether it could lead to any meaningful career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the mixture of reactions, whether supportive or doubtful, only fueled Roberts’ determination to prove that the concept of remote work and digital nomadism could be more than just a pipe dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;Life-Today&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Life-Today&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Life Today&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Life Today&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what is Steven doing now? Well, after his groundbreaking bicycle journey across the United States, Roberts continued to embrace his technomadic lifestyle to inspire a new generation of digital nomads by sharing his wisdom and expertise through speaking engagements, workshops, and various media platforms. He explored further technological frontiers and authored several books, sharing his experiences and insights into a world that has now fully embraced remote work and digital nomadism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, he is still working remotely from his home: A boat c:&lt;/p&gt;

His fusion of technology and nomadic living challenged societal norms and laid the groundwork for the modern-day remote work revolution. Although met with both curiosity and skepticism, Roberts’ determination and vision proved that the impossible can become possible with courage and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet revolution that followed in the 1990s and early 2000s further expanded the possibilities for remote work and nomadic living. Today, countless individuals around the globe are living the dream that Roberts dared to dream decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The internet has become soulless and i hate it</title>

            <description><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;Do you remember the early days of the internet, when websites were a reflection of their creators unique personalities and passions? A time when the digital landscape was a canvas of vibrant colors and creativity, and the online community was the driving force behind its evolution? The internet of yesteryear was a place of genuine connection, diversity, and personal expression. The golden era when the web was a virtual wonderland, ruled by users rather than profit-driven corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/2023/07/25/beautiful-internet/internet.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Internet”, an unknown 90’s stock image&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;The-Personal-Touch&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#The-Personal-Touch&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;The Personal Touch&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Personal Touch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back then, websites were more like digital diaries. Each website felt like stepping into the creator’s mind – a place where they poured their heart and soul, sharing their interests, hobbies, and thoughts with the world. Sadly, im simply too young to remember such a place in detail but i was able to experience some of it during my first steps on the internet back in 2009, when most of these sites were still up and big companies did not yet have the upper hand over the internet.. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the internet provided a platform for enthusiasts to come together and create niche communities. From fan forums to personal blogs, people found like-minded individuals who shared their passions, creating a sense of camaraderie that was truly special. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/2023/07/25/beautiful-internet/forum.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://forum.melonland.net/&#34;&gt;Melonland&lt;/a&gt; forum&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;Colorful-Creativity&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Colorful-Creativity&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Colorful Creativity&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Colorful Creativity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each blog was an explosion of colors and creativity. Every website had its own distinctive flair, reflecting the personality of its creator. Whether it was the playful use of neon colors or the subtle elegance of pastel shades, each one stood out from the rest, showcasing the artistry and individuality of its designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web pages were adorned with animated backgrounds, cursor trails, and unique icons. Yes, some might argue that it could get overwhelming at times, but it was just this boundless creativity that made every browsing experience a delightfully unpredictable adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/2023/07/25/beautiful-internet/gifypet.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gifypet.neocities.org/&#34;&gt;Gifypet&lt;/a&gt;, a gif pet creation tool (??!!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;User-Centric-Community&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#User-Centric-Community&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;User-Centric Community&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;User-Centric Community&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In those days, the internet was driven by its users. Their sites were designed to engage and entertain, not to bombard visitors with advertisements or collect data for profit. Online interactions were genuine, and social media platforms were still in their infancy, free from the burden of algorithms and targeted advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The online community was a powerful force, shaping the internet’s evolution through collaborative efforts and shared feedback. User-generated content, such as forums, chat rooms, and guest books, encouraged open discussions and fostered a sense of belonging in the digital realm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/2023/07/25/beautiful-internet/blog-color.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;Big-corpo&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Big-corpo&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Big corpo&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Big corpo&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As time passed, the internet underwent a transformation. The rise of social media giants and corporate interests gradually shifted the balance of power from users to profit-driven organizations. The personalized, colorful web pages became streamlined, conforming to modern design standards and sacrificing individuality for uniformity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online communities lost some of their authenticity, as algorithms began to dictate content and user engagement. The once user-centric internet was now influenced by commercial interests, and our online experiences were curated based on our data, making it harder to find the hidden gems we once stumbled upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I alwas catch myself rotating between the same few websites where all of them happen to be blank and soulless social media sites. Every profile looks the same and i hate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;Can-we-get-back&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Can-we-get-back&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Can we get back?&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Can we get back?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the internet may have evolved into a more streamlined and efficient entity, but the nostalgia for the old days persists. As we navigate the modern digital landscape, let us not forget the vibrant, user-driven internet of the past, and strive to preserve the spirit of creativity, personalization, and community in our online interactions. After all, the true beauty of the internet lies in the hands of its users – both then and now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not all hope is lost and there are some great gems hidden in the depth of the web, which we can enjoy and take an example from. We should let it inspire us to create new blogs and such sites by ourself to (maybe) revive this era of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently stumbled upon &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiby.me/&#34;&gt;Wiby&lt;/a&gt;, which is a search engine that only indexes Web1.0 sites. I’ve already spent hours surfing through those colorful pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a special webhoster called &lt;a href=&#34;https://neocities.org/&#34;&gt;Neocities&lt;/a&gt; where users can create retro looking pages and host them for free. (Even you could create one as well!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://dollchan.net/chanlist/chanlist-en.html&#34;&gt;couple of imageboards&lt;/a&gt; still exist, who remind us of a different time. You may not like it, but even &lt;a href=&#34;https://4chan.org/&#34;&gt;4chan&lt;/a&gt; is such a place and i am happy that dumpster is still around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also currently working on a Web1.0 version of my blog. &lt;del&gt;I’ll probably update this entry and link to it, once it’s finished.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.kicker.dev/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here it is!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;In recent years, WhatsApp has become one of the most popular messaging apps worldwide, connecting billions of people across the globe. However, beneath its seemingly user-friendly interface, there are growing concerns about privacy, security, and the impact of its corporate parent, Facebook. As a result, many users are seeking alternatives to WhatsApp that prioritize their digital well-being. However, it seems like most people are switching to another messenger that I’m pretty unsure about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;It’s-open-source-Right&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#It’s-open-source-Right&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;It’s open source. Right?&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It’s open source. Right?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telegram states the following on their website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telegram apps are open source and support reproducible builds. Anyone can independently verify that Telegram apps you download from App Store or Google Play were built using the exact same code that we publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Telegram&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://telegram.org/apps&#34;&gt;telegram.org/apps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While those two sentences are not wrong, they are dangerously misleading consumers. See, what they are stating here is that their &lt;strong&gt;clients&lt;/strong&gt; are open source. Their server code however still remains &lt;strong&gt;closed&lt;/strong&gt; and therefore we do not know what Telegram actually does with our data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;No-encryption-no-peace-of-mind&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#No-encryption-no-peace-of-mind&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;No encryption, no peace of mind&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;No encryption, no peace of mind&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Telegram offers end-to-end encryption in its “Secret Chats,” this feature is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howtogeek.com/709484/how-to-start-an-encrypted-secret-chat-in-telegram/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;not enabled by default&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for regular chats. This means that the content of your conversations may not be fully secure unless you specifically &lt;strong&gt;opt in&lt;/strong&gt; for Secret Chats. Telegram has also faced criticism regarding the lack of independent audits of its encryption protocols, unlike Signal, which has undergone extensive third-party security audits. Without such audits, it is rather hard to prove that their E2EE is powerfull enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;But-what-should-we-use-instead&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#But-what-should-we-use-instead&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;But what should we use instead&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;But what should we use instead&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many other great privacy respecting messenging apps which i’d rather use than telegram. I’ve listed my favorite ones below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.signal.org/de/&#34;&gt;Signal&lt;/a&gt;: Known for its strong encryption, Signal offers end-to-end encryption by default for all conversations and has a focus on user privacy. Like I already said, it has undergone independent security audits and is widely regarded as one of the most secure messaging apps available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://threema.ch/de&#34;&gt;Threema&lt;/a&gt;: Probably the OG because it’s the oldest one. Also requires no phone number to sign up (!!!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://element.io/&#34;&gt;Element&lt;/a&gt; (Matrix): Element is an open-source, decentralized messaging platform that uses the &lt;a href=&#34;https://matrix.org/&#34;&gt;Matrix protocol&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Data about data</title>

            <description><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;I am a huge fan of gathering, analyzing and evaluating data. Creating statistics and colorful graphs just has something to it. But the interesting part is not necessarily the data itself, it’s the data about the data. How often does something occur, at which time and by whom are very important characteristics when it comes to creating patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, let’s look at the two weekday-graphs of two different WhatsApp chats of mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weekdays Chat A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/2023/05/18/whatsapp-analyze/hourchartA.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weekdays Chat B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/2023/05/18/whatsapp-analyze/hourchartB.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not that hard to figure out the difference between those two graphs. The number of daily messages in A is pretty stable except for Friday and Monday, which are two extremes. Maybe this could be about a friend group planning what they’re going to do on the weekend? The general quantity of messages is also lower as in figure B. The second chat also has a huge gap between Sunday and Saturday. Could this be a group chat related to work? Or is it someone close who happens to live in the same house?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that it is possible to gather connections and create assumptions about certain topics without even looking at the data itself. Now let’s take a deeper look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Days-Heatmap Chat A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/2023/05/18/whatsapp-analyze/heatmapA.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How interesting. We can see that the group is most active between the end of January till May and spikes again in October. If you happen to live in Austria, you probably know what that means. See, in most areas, the Austrian summer break for students lasts from June till the beginning of September while Christmas lasts from December to January. There is also one small break during November. You can clearly see that this could be a chat between friends who happen to be students but don’t have the same classes together. They probably spend a lot of their free time together, which explains the lack of data during the breaks. No one texts another person while they’re sitting next to them… right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Days-Heatmap Chat B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/2023/05/18/whatsapp-analyze/heatmapB.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that the amount of messages remains pretty stable. This could prove our theory of two people in the same household as true. Maybe the gap in August could be a planned vacation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be pretty frighting if I told you all our assumptions were correct. Right? You may now probably recognize that metadata is a lot more valuable than you originally thought. But what conclusions can we draw from this newly gained awareness? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people rely on the encryption of their messaging apps. If no one can read my data then I am safe, right? No. As we can see, an attacker does not need access to your communication in order to gather valuable information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to look more into this topic, I’d recommend watching &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YpwsdRKt8Q&#34;&gt;Daniel Kriesel’s 33c3 presentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
